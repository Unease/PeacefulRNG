# PeacefulRNG
A mod that removes the hunger status effect randomness
from rotten flesh, raw chicken, and poisonous potatoes
## Compatible Versions
1.12.2
## How to Use
By default, the command /peacefulrng has all foods active. If you want to customize which foods to be enabled or disabled, you can do /peacefulrng <food>. 
If you want to check which foods are active, you can also do /peacefulrng status.
The watermark goes away if you install TASMod / LoTAS since this mod is supposed to be meant for TASing.
