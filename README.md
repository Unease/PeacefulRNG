## How to Use
By default, the command /toggleprng is set to true. If you want to customize which foods to be enabled or disabled, you can do /toggleprng <food>. 
If you want to check which foods are active, you can also do /toggleprng status.
The watermark goes away if you install TASMod / LoTAS since this mod is supposed to be meant for TASing.
